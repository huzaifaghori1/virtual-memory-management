here in the code:
The virtual memory management system is to optimize memory utilization, improve system performance, and provide seamless experience to users by transparently swapping data between the main memory and secondary storage.
address file: The code generates a random set of virtual addresses and stores them in a file
backingstore.bin:The backing store serves as a simulated secondary storage where data is stored when it is not present in the main memory.
